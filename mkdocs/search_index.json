This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g.\n\ngetServiceManager()\n) from the array representation.\n\n\nIt comes with a helpful \nComposite\n implementation, and several filters for\ncommon use cases. The filters are composed in the \nAbstractHydrator\n, so you can\nstart using them immediately in any custom extensions you write that extend that\nclass.\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Filter;\n\ninterface FilterInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Should return true, if the given filter\n     * does not match\n     *\n     * @param string $property The name of the property\n     * @return bool\n     */\n    public function filter($property);\n}\n\n\n\nIf it returns true, the key/value pairs will be in the extracted arrays - if it\nreturns false, you'll not see them again.\n\n\nFilter implementations\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\GetFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to decide which getters will\nbe extracted. It checks if the key to extract starts with \nget\n or the object\ncontains a method beginning with \nget\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::getFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\HasFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to decide which \nhas\n methods\nwill be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with \nhas\n or the\nobject contains a method beginning with \nhas\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::hasFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\IsFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to decide which \nis\n methods\nwill be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with \nis\n or the\nobject contains a method beginning with \nis\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::isFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\MethodMatchFilter\n\n\nThis filter allows you to omit methods during extraction that match the\ncondition defined in the composite.  The name of the method is specified in the\nconstructor of this filter; the second parameter decides whether to use white or\nblacklisting to decide (whitelisting retains only the matching method, blacklist\nomits any matching method). The default is blacklisting - pass \nfalse\n to change\nthe behavior.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\NumberOfParameterFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to check the number of\nparameters. By convention, the \nget\n, \nhas\n and \nis\n methods do not get any\nparameters - but it may happen. You can add your own number of required\nparameters, simply add the number to the constructor. The default value is 0. If\nthe method has more or fewer parameters than what the filter accepts, it will be\nomitted.\n\n\nRemove filters\n\n\nIf you want to tell e.g. the \nClassMethods\n hydrator, to not extract methods that start with \nis\n,\nremove the related filter:\n\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethods(false);\n$hydrator->removeFilter('is');\n\n\n\nAfter performing the above, the key/value pairs for \nis\n methods will not end up\nin your extracted array anymore. The filters can be used in any hydrator, but\nthe \nClassMethods\n hydrator is the only one, that has pre-registered filters:\n\n\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('is', new IsFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('has', new HasFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter(\n    'parameter',\n    new NumberOfParameterFilter(),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n\n\nIf these are not appropriate for your object, you can unregister them as shown\nin the previous example.\n\n\nAdd filters\n\n\nYou can add filters to any hydrator that extends the \nAbstractHydrator\n. Filters\ncan either implement \nFilterInterface\n, or simply be PHP callables:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {\n    if (strlen($property) !== 3) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n});\n\n\n\nBy default, every filter you add will be added with a conditional \nor\n. If you\nwant to add it with \nand\n (as the \nNumberOfParameterFilter\n that is added to the\n\nClassMethods\n hydrator by default), provide the conditon as the third argument\nto \naddFilter\n:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {\n    if (strlen($property) !== 3) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n\n\nOne common use case for filters is to omit getters for values that you do not\nwant to represent, such as a service manager instance:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter(\n  'servicemanager',\n  new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),\n  FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n\n\nThe example above will exclude the \ngetServiceManager()\n method and the\n\nservicemanager\n key from extraction, even if the \nget\n filter wants to add it.\n\n\nUse FilterComposite for complex filters\n\n\nFilterComposite\n implements \nFilterInterface\n as well, so you can add it as\na regular filter to the hydrator. One benefit of this implementation is that you\ncan add the filters with a condition and accomplish complex requirements using\ndifferent composites with different conditions. You can pass the following\nconditions to the 3rd parameter, when you add a filter:\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR\n\n\nAt the given level of the composite, at least one filter in that condition block\nhas to return true to extract the value.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n\n\nAt the given level of the composite, all filters in that condition block must\nreturn true to extract the value.\n\n\nFilterComposite Examples\n\n\nThis composition will have a similar logic as the if below:\n\n\n$composite = new FilterComposite();\n\n$composite->addFilter('one', $condition1);\n$composite->addFilter('two', $condition2);\n$composite->addFilter('three', $condition3);\n$composite->addFilter('four', $condition4, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n$composite->addFilter('five', $condition5, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n// This is what's happening internally\nif (\n     ($condition1\n        || $condition2\n        || $condition3\n     ) && ($condition4\n        && $condition5\n     )\n) {\n    //do extraction\n}\n\n\n\nIf you only have one condition (e.g., only an \nand\n or \nor\n) block, the other\none will be completely ignored.\n\n\nA bit more complex filter can look like this:\n\n\n$composite = new FilterComposite();\n$composite->addFilter(\n    'servicemanager',\n    new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n$composite->addFilter(\n    'eventmanager',\n    new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('excludes', $composite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n// Internal\nif (( // default composite inside the hydrator\n        ($getFilter\n            || $hasFilter\n            || $isFilter\n        ) && (\n            $numberOfParameterFilter\n        )\n   ) && ( // new composite, added to the one above\n        $serviceManagerFilter\n        && $eventManagerFilter\n   )\n) {\n    // do extraction\n}\n\n\n\nIf you perform this on the \nClassMethods\n hydrator, all getters will get\nextracted, except for \ngetServiceManager()\n and \ngetEventManager()\n.\n\n\nUsing the provider interface\n\n\nFilterProviderInterface\n allows you to configure the behavior of the hydrator\ninside your objects.\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Filter;\n\ninterface FilterProviderInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Provides a filter for hydration\n     *\n     * @return FilterInterface\n     */\n    public function getFilter();\n}\n\n\n\n(The \ngetFilter()\n method is automatically excluded from \nextract()\n.) If the\nextracted object implements the \nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterProviderInterface\n,\nthe returned \nFilterInterface\n instance can also be a \nFilterComposite\n.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nClass Foo implements FilterProviderInterface\n{\n     public function getFoo()\n     {\n         return 'foo';\n     }\n\n     public function hasFoo()\n     {\n         return true;\n     }\n\n     public function getServiceManager()\n     {\n         return 'servicemanager';\n     }\n\n     public function getEventManager()\n     {\n         return 'eventmanager';\n     }\n\n     public function getFilter()\n     {\n         $composite = new FilterComposite();\n         $composite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());\n\n         $exclusionComposite = new FilterComposite();\n         $exclusionComposite->addFilter(\n             'servicemanager',\n             new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),\n             FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n             );\n         $exclusionComposite->addFilter(\n             'eventmanager',\n             new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'),\n             FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n         );\n\n         $composite->addFilter('excludes', $exclusionComposite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n         return $composite;\n     }\n}\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethods(false);\n$extractedArray = $hydrator->extract(new Foo());\n\n\n\n$extractedArray\n will only have 'foo' => 'foo'; all other values are\nexcluded from extraction.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAll pre-registered filters from the \nClassMethods\n hydrator are ignored when\nthis interface is used.",
