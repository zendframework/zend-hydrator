This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g.\n\ngetServiceManager()\n) from the array representation.\n\n\nIt comes with a helpful \nComposite\n implementation, and several filters for\ncommon use cases. The filters are composed in the \nAbstractHydrator\n, so you can\nstart using them immediately in any custom extensions you write that extend that\nclass.\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Filter;\n\ninterface FilterInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Should return true, if the given filter does not match.\n     */\n    public function filter(string $property) : bool;\n}\n\n\n\nIf it returns true, the key/value pairs will be in the extracted arrays - if it\nreturns false, you'll not see them again.\n\n\nFilter implementations\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\GetFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n to decide which getters will\nbe extracted. It checks if the key to extract starts with \nget\n or the object\ncontains a method beginning with \nget\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::getFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\HasFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n to decide which \nhas\n methods\nwill be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with \nhas\n or the\nobject contains a method beginning with \nhas\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::hasFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\IsFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n to decide which \nis\n methods\nwill be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with \nis\n or the\nobject contains a method beginning with \nis\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::isFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\MethodMatchFilter\n\n\nThis filter allows you to omit methods during extraction that match the\ncondition defined in the composite.  The name of the method is specified in the\nconstructor of this filter; the second parameter decides whether to use white or\nblacklisting to decide (whitelisting retains only the matching method, blacklist\nomits any matching method). The default is blacklisting - pass \nfalse\n to change\nthe behavior.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\NumberOfParameterFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n to check the number of\nparameters. By convention, the \nget\n, \nhas\n and \nis\n methods do not get any\nparameters - but it may happen. You can add your own number of required\nparameters, simply add the number to the constructor. The default value is 0. If\nthe method has more or fewer parameters than what the filter accepts, it will be\nomitted.\n\n\nUse FilterComposite for complex filters\n\n\nFilterComposite\n implements \nFilterInterface\n as well, so you can add it as a\nregular filter to the hydrator. One benefit of this implementation is that you\ncan add the filters with a condition and accomplish complex requirements using\ndifferent filters with different conditions. You can pass the following\nconditions to the 3rd parameter, when you add a filter:\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR\n\n\nAt the given level of the composite, at least one filter set using\n\nCONDITION_OR\n must return true to extract the value.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n\n\nAt the given level of the composite, \nall\n filters set using \nCONDITION_AND\n\nmust return true to extract the value.\n\n\nFilterComposite Examples\n\n\nTo illustrate how conditions apply when composing filters, consider the\nfollowing set of filters:\n\n\n$composite = new FilterComposite();\n\n$composite->addFilter('one', $condition1);\n$composite->addFilter('two', $condition2);\n$composite->addFilter('three', $condition3);\n$composite->addFilter('four', $condition4, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n$composite->addFilter('five', $condition5, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n\n\nThe above is roughly equivalent to the following conditional:\n\n\n// This is what's happening internally\nif (\n     ($condition1\n        || $condition2\n        || $condition3\n     ) && ($condition4\n        && $condition5\n     )\n) {\n    // do extraction\n}\n\n\n\nIf you only have one condition block (e.g., only \nAND\n or \nOR\n filters), the\nother condition type will be completely ignored.\n\n\nA bit more complex filter can look like this:\n\n\n$composite = new FilterComposite();\n$composite->addFilter(\n    'servicemanager',\n    new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n$composite->addFilter(\n    'eventmanager',\n    new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('excludes', $composite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n// Internal\nif (( // default composite inside the ClassMethodsHydrator:\n        ($getFilter\n            || $hasFilter\n            || $isFilter\n        ) && (\n            $numberOfParameterFilter\n        )\n   ) && ( // new composite, added to the one above\n        $serviceManagerFilter\n        && $eventManagerFilter\n   )\n) {\n    // do extraction\n}\n\n\n\nIf you perform this on the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n, all getters will get\nextracted, except for \ngetServiceManager()\n and \ngetEventManager()\n.\n\n\nUsing the provider interface\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterProviderInterface\n allows you to configure the\nbehavior of the hydrator inside your objects.\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Filter;\n\ninterface FilterProviderInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Provides a filter for hydration\n     *\n     * @return FilterInterface\n     */\n    public function getFilter();\n}\n\n\n\n(The \ngetFilter()\n method is automatically excluded from \nextract()\n.) If the\nextracted object implements the \nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterProviderInterface\n,\nthe returned \nFilterInterface\n instance can also be a \nFilterComposite\n.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nClass Foo implements FilterProviderInterface\n{\n     public function getFoo()\n     {\n         return 'foo';\n     }\n\n     public function hasFoo()\n     {\n         return true;\n     }\n\n     public function getServiceManager()\n     {\n         return 'servicemanager';\n     }\n\n     public function getEventManager()\n     {\n         return 'eventmanager';\n     }\n\n     public function getFilter()\n     {\n         $composite = new FilterComposite();\n         $composite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());\n\n         $exclusionComposite = new FilterComposite();\n         $exclusionComposite->addFilter(\n             'servicemanager',\n             new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),\n             FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n             );\n         $exclusionComposite->addFilter(\n             'eventmanager',\n             new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'),\n             FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n         );\n\n         $composite->addFilter('excludes', $exclusionComposite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n         return $composite;\n     }\n}\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(false);\n$extractedArray = $hydrator->extract(new Foo());\n\n\n\n$extractedArray\n will only have 'foo' => 'foo'; all other values are\nexcluded from extraction.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAll pre-registered filters from the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n hydrator are ignored when\nthis interface is used. More on those methods below.\n\n\n\n\nFilter-enabled hydrators and the composite filter\n\n\nHydrators can indicate they are filter-enabled by implementing\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterEnabledInterface\n:\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Filter;\n\ninterface FilterEnabledInterface extends FilterProviderInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Add a new filter to take care of what needs to be hydrated.\n     * To exclude e.g. the method getServiceLocator:\n     *\n     * <code>\n     * $composite->addFilter(\n     *     \"servicelocator\",\n     *     function ($property) {\n     *         [$class, $method] = explode('::', $property, 2);\n     *         return $method !== 'getServiceLocator';\n     *     },\n     *     FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n     * );\n     * </code>\n     *\n     * @param string $name Index in the composite\n     * @param callable|FilterInterface $filter\n     */\n    public function addFilter(string $name, $filter, int $condition = FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR) : void;\n\n    /**\n     * Check whether a specific filter exists at key $name or not\n     *\n     * @param string $name Index in the composite\n     */\n    public function hasFilter(string $name) : bool;\n\n    /**\n     * Remove a filter from the composition.\n     *\n     * To not extract \"has\" methods, you simply need to unregister it\n     *\n     * <code>\n     * $filterComposite->removeFilter('has');\n     * </code>\n     */\n    public function removeFilter(string $name) : void;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the interface extends \nFilterProviderInterface\n, which means it also\nincludes the \ngetFilter()\n method.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFilterEnabledInterface\n makes the assumption that the class will be backed\nby a \nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite\n; the various \naddFilter()\n,\n\nhasFilter()\n, and \nremoveFilter()\n methods are expected to proxy to a\n\nFilterComposite\n instance.\n\n\nAbstractHydrator\n, on which all the hydrators shipped in this package are\nbuilt, implements \nFilterEnabledInterface\n. Of the hydrators shipped, only one,\n\nClassMethodsHydrator\n, defines any filters from the outset. Its constructor\nincludes the following:\n\n\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('is', new IsFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('has', new HasFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter(\n    'parameter',\n    new NumberOfParameterFilter(),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n\n\nRemove filters\n\n\nIf you want to tell a filter-enabled hydrator such as \nClassMethodsHydrator\n not\nto extract methods that start with \nis\n, remove the related filter:\n\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(false);\n$hydrator->removeFilter('is');\n\n\n\nAfter performing the above, the key/value pairs for \nis\n methods will no longer\nend up in your extracted array.\n\n\nAdd filters\n\n\nYou can add filters using the \naddFilter()\n method. Filters can either implement\n\nFilterInterface\n, or simply be PHP callables:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {\n    return strlen($property) === 3;\n});\n\n\n\nBy default, every filter you add will be added with a conditional \nOR\n. If you\nwant to add it with \nAND\n (such as the \nClassMethodsHydrator\n does with its\ncomposed \nNumberOfParameterFilter\n, demonstrated above) provide the conditon as\nthe third argument to \naddFilter\n:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {\n    return strlen($property) === 3;\n}, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);\n\n\n\nOne common use case for filters is to omit getters for values that you do not\nwant to represent, such as a service manager instance:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter(\n    'servicemanager',\n    new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n\n\nThe example above will exclude the \ngetServiceManager()\n method and the\n\nservicemanager\n key from extraction, even if the \nget\n filter wants to add it.",

For this reason, their return types are listed as mixed, versus as\n\narray\n and \nobject\n, respectively.\n\n\nAdding strategies to the hydrators\n\n\nThis package provides the interface \nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyEnabledInterface\n.\nHydrators can implement this interface, and then call on its \ngetStrategy()\n\nmethod in order to extract or hydrate individual values. The interface has the\nfollowing definition:\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Strategy;\n\ninterface StrategyEnabledInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Adds the given strategy under the given name.\n     */\n    public function addStrategy(string $name, StrategyInterface $strategy) : void;\n\n    /**\n     * Gets the strategy with the given name.\n     */\n    public function getStrategy(string $name) : StrategyInterface;\n\n    /**\n     * Checks if the strategy with the given name exists.\n     */\n    public function hasStrategy(string $name) : bool;\n\n    /**\n     * Removes the strategy with the given name.\n     */\n    public function removeStrategy(string $name) : void;\n}\n\n\n\nWe provide a default implementation of the interface as part of\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\AbstractHydrator\n; it uses an array property to store and\nretrieve strategies by name when extracting and hydrating values. Since all\nshipped hydrators are based on \nAbstractHydrator\n, they share these\ncapabilities.\n\n\nAdditionally, the functionality that consumes strategies within\n\nAbstractHydrator\n also contains checks if a naming strategy is composed, and,\nif present, will use it to translate the property name prior to looking up a\n  strategy for it.\n\n\nAvailable implementations\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\BooleanStrategy\n\n\nThis strategy converts values into Booleans and vice versa. It expects two\narguments at the constructor, which are used to define value maps for \ntrue\n and\n\nfalse\n.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ClosureStrategy\n\n\nThis is a strategy that allows you to pass in options for:\n\n\n\n\nhydrate\n, a callback to be called when hydrating a value, and\n\n\nextract\n, a callback to be called when extracting a value.\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy\n\n\nDateTimeFormatterStrategy\n provides bidirectional conversion between strings\nand DateTime instances. The input and output formats can be provided as\nconstructor arguments.\n\n\nThe strategy allows \nDateTime\n formats that use \n!\n to prepend the format, or\n\n|\n or \n+\n to append it; these ensure that, during hydration, the new \nDateTime\n\ninstance created will set the time element accordingly. As a specific example,\n\nY-m-d|\n will drop the time component, ensuring comparisons are based on a\nmidnight time value.\n\n\nStarting in version 3.0, the constructor defines a third, optional argument,\n\n$dateTimeFallback\n.  If enabled and hydration fails, the given string is parsed\nby the \nDateTime\n constructor, as demonstrated below:\n\n\n// Previous behavior:\n$strategy = new Zend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy('Y-m-d H:i:s.uP');\n$hydrated1 = $strategy->hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40.123456+01'); // Format is the same; returns DateTime instance\n$hydrated2 = $strategy->hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40+01');        // Format is different; value is not hydrated\n\n// Using new $dateTimeFallback flag; both values are hydrated:\n$strategy = new Zend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy('Y-m-d H:i:s.uP', null, true);\n$hydrated1 = $strategy->hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40.123456+01');\n$hydrated2 = $strategy->hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40+01');\n\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DefaultStrategy\n\n\nThe \nDefaultStrategy\n simply proxies everything through, without performing any\nconversion of values.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ExplodeStrategy\n\n\nThis strategy is a wrapper around PHP's \nimplode()\n and \nexplode()\n functions.\nThe delimiter and a limit can be provided to the constructor; the limit will\nonly be used for \nextract\n operations.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\SerializableStrategy\n\n\nSerializableStrategy\n provides the functionality backing\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializableHydrator\n. You can use it with custom\nimplementations for \nZend\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface\n if you want to as\nwell.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyChain\n\n\nThis strategy takes an array of \nStrategyInterface\n instances and iterates\nover them when performing \nextract()\n and \nhydrate()\n operations. Each operates\non the return value of the previous, allowing complex operations based on\nsmaller, single-purpose strategies.\n\n\nWriting custom strategies\n\n\nThe following example, while not terribly useful, will provide you with the\nbasics for writing your own strategies, as well as provide ideas as to where and\nwhen to use them. This strategy simply transforms the value for the defined key\nusing \nstr_rot13()\n during both the \nextract()\n and \nhydrate()\n operations:\n\n\nclass Rot13Strategy implements StrategyInterface\n{\n    public function extract($value)\n    {\n        return str_rot13($value);\n    }\n\n    public function hydrate($value)\n    {\n        return str_rot13($value);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis is the example class with which we want to use the hydrator example:\n\n\nclass Foo\n{\n    protected $foo = null;\n    protected $bar = null;\n\n    public function getFoo()\n    {\n        return $this->foo;\n    }\n\n    public function setFoo($foo)\n    {\n        $this->foo = $foo;\n    }\n\n    public function getBar()\n    {\n        return $this->bar;\n    }\n\n    public function setBar($bar)\n    {\n        $this->bar = $bar;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nNow, we'll add the \nrot13\n strategy to the method \ngetFoo()\n and \nsetFoo($foo)\n:\n\n\n$foo = new Foo();\n$foo->setFoo('bar');\n$foo->setBar('foo');\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator();\n$hydrator->addStrategy('foo', new Rot13Strategy());\n\n\n\nWhen you use the hydrator to extract an array for the object \n$foo\n, you'll\nreceive the following:\n\n\n$extractedArray = $hydrator->extract($foo);\n\n// array(2) {\n//     [\"foo\"]=>\n//     string(3) \"one\"\n//     [\"bar\"]=>\n//     string(3) \"foo\"\n// }\n\n\n\nAnd when hydrating a new \nFoo\n instance:\n\n\n$hydrator->hydrate($extractedArray, $foo)\n\n// object(Foo)#2 (2) {\n//   [\"foo\":protected]=>\n//   string(3) \"bar\"\n//   [\"bar\":protected]=>\n//   string(3) \"foo\"\n// }",

Essentially, they only need to\nimplement the \nPSR-11 ContainerInterface\n,\nbut plugin managers in current versions of \nzend-servicemanager\n\nonly implement it indirectly via the container-interop project.\n\n\nAs such, we ship \nZend\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManagerInterface\n, which simply\nextends the PSR-11 \nPsr\\Container\\ContainerInterface\n. Each of our\nimplementations implement it.\n\n\nHydratorPluginManager\n\n\nIf you have used zend-hydrator prior to version 3, you are likely already\nfamiliar with this class, as it has been the implementation we have shipped from\ninitial versions. The \nHydratorPluginManager\n extends the zend-servicemanager\n\nAbstractPluginManager\n, and has the following behaviors:\n\n\n\n\nIt will only return \nZend\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface\n instances.\n\n\nIt defines short-name aliases for all shipped hydrators (the class name minus\n  the namespace), in a variety of casing combinations.\n\n\nAll but the \nDelegatingHydrator\n are defined as invokable services (meaning\n  they can be instantiated without any constructor arguments).\n\n\nThe \nDelegatingHydrator\n is configured as a factory-based service, mapping to\n  the \nZend\\Hydrator\\DelegatingHydratorFactory\n.\n\n\nNo services are shared; a new instance is created each time you call \nget()\n.\n\n\n\n\nHydratorPluginManagerFactory\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManager\n is mapped to the factory\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManagerFactory\n when wired to the dependency\ninjection container.\n\n\nThe factory will look for the \nconfig\n service, and use the \nhydrators\n\nconfiguration key to seed it with additional services. This configuration key\nshould map to an array that follows \nstandard zend-servicemanager configuration\n.\n\n\nStandaloneHydratorPluginManager\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\StandaloneHydratorPluginManager\n provides an implementation that\nhas no dependencies on other libraries. \nIt can only load the hydrators shipped\nwith zend-hydrator\n.\n\n\nStandardHydratorPluginManagerFactory\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\StandardHydratorPluginManager\n is mapped to the factory\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\StandardHydratorPluginManagerFactory\n when wired to the dependency\ninjection container.\n\n\nHydratorManager alias\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\ConfigManager\n defines an alias service, \nHydratorManager\n. That\nservice will point to \nZend\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManager\n if\nzend-servicemanager is installed, and \nZend\\Hydrator\\StandaloneHydratorPluginManager\n\notherwise.\n\n\nCustom plugin managers\n\n\nIf you do not want to use zend-servicemanager, but want a plugin manager that is\ncustomizable, or at least capable of loading the hydrators you have defined for\nyour application, you should write a custom implementation of\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManagerInterface\n, and wire it to the\n\nHydratorManager\n service, and/or one of the existing service names.\n\n\nAs an example, if you want a configurable solution that uses factories, and want\nthose factories capable of pulling application-level dependencies, you might do\nsomething like the following:\n\n\n// In src/YourApplication/CustomHydratorPluginManager.php:\n\nnamespace YourApplication;\n\nuse Psr\\Container\\NotFoundExceptionInterface;\nuse Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface;\nuse RuntimeException;\nuse Zend\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface;\nuse Zend\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManagerInterface;\nuse Zend\\Hydrator\\StandaloneHydratorPluginManager;\n\nclass CustomHydratorPluginManager implements HydratorPluginManagerInterface\n{\n    /** @var ContainerInterface */\n    private $appContainer;\n\n    /** @var StandaloneHydratorPluginManager */\n    private $defaults;\n\n    /** @var array<string, string|callable> */\n    private $factories = [];\n\n    public function __construct(ContainerInterface $appContainer)\n    {\n        $this->appContainer = $appContainer;\n        $this->defaults = new StandaloneHydratorPluginManager();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * {@inheritDoc}\n     */\n    public function get($id) : HydratorInterface\n    {\n        if (! isset($this->factories[$id]) && ! $this->defaults->has($id)) {\n            $message = sprintf('Hydrator service %s not found', $id);\n            throw new class($message) extends RuntimeException implements NotFoundExceptionInterface {};\n        }\n\n        // Default was requested; fallback to standalone container\n        if (! isset($this->factories[$id])) {\n            return $this->defaults->get($id);\n        }\n\n        $factory = $this->factories[$id];\n        if (is_string($factory)) {\n            $this->factories[$id] = $factory = new $factory();\n        }\n\n        return $factory($this->appContainer, $id);\n    }\n\n    public function has($id) : bool\n    {\n        return isset($this->factories[$id]) || $this->defaults->has($id);\n    }\n\n    public function setFactoryClass(string $name, string $factory) : void\n    {\n        $this->factories[$name] = $factory;\n    }\n\n    public function setFactory(string $name, callable $factory) : void\n    {\n        $this->factories[$name] = $factory;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n// In src/YourApplication/CustomHydratorPluginManagerFactory.php:\n\nnamespace YourApplication;\n\nuse Psr\\Container\\ContainerInterface;\n\nclass CustomHydratorPluginManagerFactory\n{\n    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container) : CustomHydratorPluginManager\n    {\n        $config = $container->has('config') ? $container->get('config') : [];\n        $config = $config['hydrators']['factories'] ??

Under\nzend-servicemanager v2, most special characters were removed, and the name\nnormalized to all lowercase. Now, only fully qualified class names are mapped to\nfactories, and short names (names omitting the namespace and/or \"Hydrator\"\nsuffix) are mapped as aliases.\n\n\nAdditionally, version 3 ships a standalone, PSR-11 compliant version,\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\StandaloneHydratorPluginManager\n. By default, the \nHydratorManager\n\nservice alias will point to the \nStandaloneHydratorPluginManager\n if\nzend-servicemanager is not installed, and the \nHydratorPluginManager\n otherwise.\nSee the \nplugin managers chapter\n for more details.",

This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g.\n\ngetServiceManager()\n) from the array representation.\n\n\nIt comes with a helpful \nComposite\n implementation, and several filters for\ncommon use cases. The filters are composed in the \nAbstractHydrator\n, so you can\nstart using them immediately in any custom extensions you write that extend that\nclass.\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Hydrator\\Filter;\n\ninterface FilterInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Should return true, if the given filter\n     * does not match\n     *\n     * @param string $property The name of the property\n     * @return bool\n     */\n    public function filter($property);\n}\n\n\n\nIf it returns true, the key/value pairs will be in the extracted arrays - if it\nreturns false, you'll not see them again.\n\n\nFilter implementations\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\GetFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to decide which getters will\nbe extracted. It checks if the key to extract starts with \nget\n or the object\ncontains a method beginning with \nget\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::getFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\HasFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to decide which \nhas\n methods\nwill be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with \nhas\n or the\nobject contains a method beginning with \nhas\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::hasFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\IsFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to decide which \nis\n methods\nwill be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with \nis\n or the\nobject contains a method beginning with \nis\n (e.g., \nZend\\Foo\\Bar::isFoo\n).\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\MethodMatchFilter\n\n\nThis filter allows you to omit methods during extraction that match the\ncondition defined in the composite.  The name of the method is specified in the\nconstructor of this filter; the second parameter decides whether to use white or\nblacklisting to decide (whitelisting retains only the matching method, blacklist\nomits any matching method). The default is blacklisting - pass \nfalse\n to change\nthe behavior.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Filter\\NumberOfParameterFilter\n\n\nThis filter is used in the \nClassMethods\n hydrator to check the number of\nparameters. By convention, the \nget\n, \nhas\n and \nis\n methods do not get any\nparameters - but it may happen. You can add your own number of required\nparameters, simply add the number to the constructor. The default value is 0. If\nthe method has more or fewer parameters than what the filter accepts, it will be\nomitted.\n\n\nRemove filters\n\n\nIf you want to tell e.g. the \nClassMethods\n hydrator, to not extract methods that start with \nis\n,\nremove the related filter:\n\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethods(false);\n$hydrator->removeFilter('is');\n\n\n\nAfter performing the above, the key/value pairs for \nis\n methods will not end up\nin your extracted array anymore. The filters can be used in any hydrator, but\nthe \nClassMethods\n hydrator is the only one, that has pre-registered filters:\n\n\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('is', new IsFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('has', new HasFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());\n$this->filterComposite->addFilter(\n    'parameter',\n    new NumberOfParameterFilter(),\n    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND\n);\n\n\n\nIf these are not appropriate for your object, you can unregister them as shown\nin the previous example.\n\n\nAdd filters\n\n\nYou can add filters to any hydrator that extends the \nAbstractHydrator\n. Filters\ncan either implement \nFilterInterface\n, or simply be PHP callables:\n\n\n$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {\n    if (strlen($property) !== 3) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n});\n\n\n\nBy default, every filter you add will be added with a conditional \nor\n.

As such, if you want to use this\nfunctionality in your own hydrators, you should extend \nAbstractHydrator\n.\n\n\nAvailable implementations\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\BooleanStrategy\n\n\nThis strategy converts values into Booleans and vice versa. It expects two\narguments at the constructor, which are used to define value maps for \ntrue\n and\n\nfalse\n.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ClosureStrategy\n\n\nThis is a strategy that allows you to pass in options for:\n\n\n\n\nhydrate\n, a callback to be called when hydrating a value, and\n\n\nextract\n, a callback to be called when extracting a value.\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy\n\n\nDateTimeFormatterStrategy\n provides bidirectional conversion between strings\nand DateTime instances. The input and output formats can be provided as\nconstructor arguments.\n\n\nAs of version 2.4.1, this strategy now allows \nDateTime\n formats that use \n!\n to\nprepend the format, or \n|\n or \n+\n to append it; these ensure that, during\nhydration, the new \nDateTime\n instance created will set the time element\naccordingly. As a specific example, \nY-m-d|\n will drop the time component,\nensuring comparisons are based on a midnight time value.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DefaultStrategy\n\n\nThe \nDefaultStrategy\n simply proxies everything through, without performing any\nconversion of values.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ExplodeStrategy\n\n\nThis strategy is a wrapper around PHP's \nimplode()\n and \nexplode()\n functions.\nThe delimiter and a limit can be provided to the constructor; the limit will\nonly be used for \nextract\n operations.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\SerializableStrategy\n\n\nSerializableStrategy\n provides the functionality backing\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializable\n. You can use it with custom implementations\nfor \nZend\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface\n if you want to as well.\n\n\nZend\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyChain\n\n\nThis strategy takes an array of \nStrategyInterface\n instances and iterates\nover them when performing \nextract()\n and \nhydrate()\n operations. Each operates\non the return value of the previous, allowing complex operations based on\nsmaller, single-purpose strategies.\n\n\nWriting custom strategies\n\n\nThe following example, while not terribly useful, will provide you with the\nbasics for writing your own strategies, as well as provide ideas as to where and\nwhen to use them. This strategy simply transforms the value for the defined key\nusing \nstr_rot13()\n during both the \nextract()\n and \nhydrate()\n operations:\n\n\nclass Rot13Strategy implements StrategyInterface\n{\n    public function extract($value)\n    {\n        return str_rot13($value);\n    }\n\n    public function hydrate($value)\n    {\n        return str_rot13($value);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis is the example class with which we want to use the hydrator example:\n\n\nclass Foo\n{\n    protected $foo = null;\n    protected $bar = null;\n\n    public function getFoo()\n    {\n        return $this->foo;\n    }\n\n    public function setFoo($foo)\n    {\n        $this->foo = $foo;\n    }\n\n    public function getBar()\n    {\n        return $this->bar;\n    }\n\n    public function setBar($bar)\n    {\n        $this->bar = $bar;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nNow, we'll add the \nrot13\n strategy to the method \ngetFoo()\n and \nsetFoo($foo)\n:\n\n\n$foo = new Foo();\n$foo->setFoo('bar');\n$foo->setBar('foo');\n\n$hydrator = new ClassMethods();\n$hydrator->addStrategy('foo', new Rot13Strategy());\n\n\n\nWhen you use the hydrator to extract an array for the object \n$foo\n, you'll\nreceive the following:\n\n\n$extractedArray = $hydrator->extract($foo);\n\n// array(2) {\n//     [\"foo\"]=>\n//     string(3) \"one\"\n//     [\"bar\"]=>\n//     string(3) \"foo\"\n// }\n\n\n\nAnd when hydrating a new \nFoo\n instance:\n\n\n$hydrator->hydrate($extractedArray, $foo)\n\n// object(Foo)#2 (2) {\n//   [\"foo\":protected]=>\n//   string(3) \"bar\"\n//   [\"bar\":protected]=>\n//   string(3) \"foo\"\n// }",
